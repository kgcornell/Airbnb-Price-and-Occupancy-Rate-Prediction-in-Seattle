Airbnb is a popular online hospitality service that connects people, who are willing to rent a part of their housing space, with people who are on the lookout for short term lodging. Review score of a lisiting is a critical metric that guides a tenant's decision making process. Moreover, review scores are used by Airbnb for quality control and policy making purposes. 

Keeping in mind the practicality of the review score, the aim of this project is to build a robust algorithm that can accurately predict review scores. We'll use data from "Inside Airbnb" to develop and train our model and will identify key features, via a sensitivity analysis, that significantly influence the review scores. The results from our study will generate great insights that can be used by Airbnb listing owners to ensure customer satisfaction which in turn would increase a property's occupancy rate.
